======= Nikola TODOs: =============
- [DONE] In BLOC Listener, listen for new user's locations and on user location received - update the state (update the user's arrow on the map)
- [DONE] On every 5s, send the current user's location (through BLOC - autohandled on timer inside the bloc)



======= Stefan TODOs: =============
- [DONE] update patrol model, add distance
- [DONE] (Stefan) In BLOC Listener, listen for new patrols and on patrol location received - update the state (update the patrols on the map).
When the user sends the current location, the response is a list of patrol models. Send the patrol models through EventBus, and listen to them in the BLOC (as I listen to user location).
Then, add the received event to the bloc, and on BlocEvent received, I'll map all the patrols to the map (and handle the logic with warnedPatrols, ...)
